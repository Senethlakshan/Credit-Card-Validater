Description : 

This web application is a simple application designed to fetch the details of a student and display it. Here
we have focused on how to implement security controls in the application.
For this, React has been used as the front end and Java Sprigboot framework has been used for the web
server.
The purpose of this grant is to demonstrate how to implement security controls in a web application and
its functionality.
Both React and Spring Boot are popular frameworks for developing web applications, and they offer a
number of features to help with security.
Among the things I have taken into consideration here,
Some of the common security controls include authentication, authorization, encryption, input validation,
error handling, and logging. Your frameworks and libraries use the latest security techniques.
